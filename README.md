# Data-Lake
the program is a database for a music streaming startup Sparkify. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. The program is an ETL pipeline in PySpark code.

## Dataset
the datasets reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data

artist_location,artist_longitude, 
artist_name,
